    "This is a classic engineering example. In fact, I think it was one of my favorites ever which truly taught me why I love using a compass so much. With nothing more than a compass and a straight edge, it's possible to calculate the tangent of a circle from any given point.\n",

    "The definition of a tangent of a circle is a when a line touches the edge of a circle once and only once. For this to occur, the tangent of a circle must form an angle perpendicular to the radius formed at the point where it touches the circle. Any tilt in either direction will overlap the circle and cause more than one point of contact.\n",
